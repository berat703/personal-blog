  How to implements Stripe to Django applications with using dj-stripe library?
  Let's find an answer this question.
---
I had the opportunity to examine dj-stripe while I researching which payment libraries used in Django projects. If you are going to integrate a payment system to your project, you may want to have features such as subscription management or Single-unit purchases. Especially subscription management quite important and time consuming subject for SaaS projects. [dj-stripe](https://dj-stripe.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) takes care of these.

### Prerequisites:

Before starting to implementation of dj-stripe, make sure that you have requirements below.

* A Django project (Django >= 2.2)
* Python >= 3.6
* Ready to use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account
* A Django project

### Installation

First of all, you should install dj-stripe with pip

```
pip install dj-stripe
```

then we‚Äôre adding **djstripe** to **INSTALLED_APPS**

```
INSTALLED_APPS =(
    ...
    "djstripe",
    ...
)
```

Add to urls.py

```
path("stripe/", include("djstripe.urls", namespace="djstripe"))
```

#### Stripe Settings

#### Webhooks

You need to add your webhook address to Stripe. Your webhook address should be like ***<https://domain.com/stripe/webhook>***You can find webhook endpoints ***Developers > Webhooks*** in Stripe Dashboard. After you create a webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard, get your webhook secret key which is starting with ***whsec_***

#### API Keys

Take your Stripe public and secret keys in ***Developers > API Keys***then add them to your .env file. Your settings.py file should be like:

```
STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY", "<your publishable key>")
STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY", "<your secret key>")
STRIPE_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY", "<your publishable key>")
STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY", "<your secret key>")
STRIPE_LIVE_MODE = False
DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "whsec_xxx"
```

dj-stripe will use your test keys while ***STRIPE_LIVE_MODE***isfalse

#### Plans

Let‚Äôs create a plan. Click *Product button* on sidebar.

![Screenshot from <https://dashboard.stripe.com/products/create>](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*izmSfPA9nJu1jrIIfTJXNw.png)

Name field is required. I created a recurring plan with 3 days free trial.

Run these commands to create dj-stripe tables, initialize exists customers on stripe and migrate created plans from Stripe to our dj-stripe tables.

```
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py djstripe_init_customers

python manage.py djstripe_sync_plans_from_stripe
```

#### Events

I need to talk about Stripe events as well. Stripe has different lots of event. You should specify which events do you want to listen from API. You may send an e-mail to customer when checkout failure or you may want to remind your customer that the subscription will end in x days. In these cases, you will choose your events that you want to listen on Stripe dashboard and you should implement a listener method for each.

Choose your events in ***Developer > Webhooks***page.

![Screenshot from <https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks/we_>xxx](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sWzEapddobs2pItF9P8nNg.png)

Let‚Äôs create an endpoint for customer deleted event.

```
from djstripe import webhooks
from django.core.mail import send_mail
@webhooks.handler("customer.deleted")
def customer_deleted_event_listener(event, **kwargs):
    send_mail(
    'Subscription Deleted',
    'See ya! üëã',
    'from@example.com',
    ['to@example.com'],
    fail_silently=False,
)
```

You can find customer info‚Äôs inside event variable.

#### **Checkout**

I prefer Stripe Checkout which means customer will pay on stripe.com domain. But you can implement it on your client application.

> [Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout) creates a secure, Stripe-hosted payment page that lets you collect payments quickly. It works across devices and is designed to increase your conversion.
>
> More info : <https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout>

In Stripe Checkout way; If you implementing a SaaS application API should create a stripe session which has some customer information about checkout step (E.g plan name, customer id)

```
customer = Customer.objects.get(subscriber=request.user)
stripe.api_key = STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
       customer=customer.id,
       payment_method_types=['card'],
       subscription_data={
       'items': [{
         'plan': request.data["plan"],
      }],
},
       success_url='http://example.com/success',
       cancel_url='http://example.com/cancelled',
)
            
data = {
"session_id": session.id
}
return JsonResponse(data, status=200)
```

After created the session id, deliver it to your client application.

We should import Stripe.js before implementing checkout steps on client.

Add this line to your .html file

```
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
```

Initialize a stripe object

```
var stripe = Stripe(YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY);
```

When customer click ‚ÄúSubscribe Now‚Äù button should run piece of code below

```
stripe.redirectToCheckout({
       sessionId: this.state.session_id
})
.then(function(result) {
    // If `redirectToCheckout` fails due to a browser or network
    // error, display the localized error message to your customer
    // using `result.error.message`.
    var displayError = document.getElementById('error-message');
    displayError.textContent = result.error.message;
});
```

When customer click the button, they will see this page below

![Preview checkout from <https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout>](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7M-Hb8RUjDB2ApkJliMAUQ.png)

P.S: If you use stripe test keys, page will see in test mode. You can test your checkout step with test card numbers.

* Default U.S. card ‚Äî `4242 4242 4242 4242`
* Authenticate with [3D Secure](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure) ‚Äî `4000 0000 0000 3220`

### Conclusion:

We‚Äôve created a successful Stripe integration with using dj-stripe project. I tried to keep writing as simple as possible in terms of quick implementation and understandability. Stripe has lots of features with amazing documentation. I suggest you to read it before using Stripe.
